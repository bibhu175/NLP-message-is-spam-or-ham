# NLP-message-is-spam-or-ham
classifying the message as "spam" or "ham". Here we explore some common techniques of NLP like:  Removing Punctuation and Stopwords Tokenizer, Bag of words Term frequency inverse document frequency (TFIDF) Based on these preprocessing, we train 6 different models that classify unknown messages as spam or ham.  Naive Bayes Classifier SVM Classifier KNN Classifier SGD Classifier Gradient Boosting Classifier XGBoost Classifier For easier handling of the preprocessing steps (for train and test data) and the optimization of different models for the same conditions, the classification is done with Pipelines including GridSearchCV. Finally, for the model evaluation different metrics are examined: accuracy, precision, recall, fscore, roc_auc.
